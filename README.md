# NBA MVP Data Analysis

Every year there is the same debate as to who should win the MVP award in the NBA. The criteria for winning this award is vague. Some say it should be the best player on a top winning team in the league while other say team performance does not matter as it is a individual award. Certain players are also ruled out of the MVP race if they have not played a certain number of games however this number is also debatable. This notebook aims to visualize some trends and attributes of MVPs over the years in order to determine which factors play a key role.

Summary: Most MVPs are on a winning team which has a team winning percentage of 70+ percent over the season games. In addition to that, most MVPs have played 70+ games over the regular season. Therefore an injury which results in a player missing more than 12 games may drastically reduce their chances of winning the award. Furthermore, the prime years for a player to win the award are between 25-29 years of age which is also the typical age ranges where a player plays at their peak level.
